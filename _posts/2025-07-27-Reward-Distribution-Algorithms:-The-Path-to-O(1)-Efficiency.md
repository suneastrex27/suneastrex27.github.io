If you distribute rewards proportionally by iterating through a user list, that's O(N). Yes, it's simple, but fundamentally broken for blockchains. As the number of users grows, gas costs go through the roof. This makes scaling impossible and destroys real-world viability for any protocol. Blockchain is not a playground where inefficiency is forgiven. If your design can't handle thousands or millions of users without blowing up fees, it's dead on arrival. In this post, I break down three mathematical approaches that solve this problem at the root, letting you achieve true O(1) pull-based reward distribution no matter how big your user base gets.

## [Fixed Stake Reward Distribution](#fixed-stake-reward-distribution)
In 2018, Bogdan et al.[^1] proposed a scalable on-chain reward distribution method in their paper "Scalable Reward Distribution on the Ethereum Blockchain." The core idea is to globally track the cumulative reward per unit stake, denoted as $S$, updating at each interval, where an interval is any event that changes the total deposit or distributes a reward.

This is summarized by:

$$
S = \sum_{t=0} \frac{reward_{t}}{T_{t}}
$$

where $T_t$ is the total deposit at interval $t$ and $j$ denotes participant. If participant $j$ deposits $stake_{j,t}$ at a time $t$, and withdraws at $t_2 > t_1$, the total reward for $j$ at $t_2$ can be computed using the global array $S_t$.

$$
reward_{j,t} = stake_{j,t} \times (S_{t} - S_{t-1})
$$

More memory-effeiciently, instead of storing all $S_{j,t}$ values globally, we can use a map $S_{j,0}$ to record the value of $S$ at the time of participant $j$'s initial deposit. When participant $j$ withdraws their entire stake, the reward is calculated as:

$$
reward_{j,t} = stake_{j,t} \times (S - S_{deposit})
$$

## [Variable Stake Reward Distribution](#variable-stake-reward-distribution)
In 2019, Onur Solmaz proposed a new method in his blog[^2]. This is an optimized upgrade of the Bogdan method, as it enables proportional reward distribution even when stake sizes change. In practice, participants rarely adjust their stake size, but the need for variable stake support still exists.

Starting from Bogdan's formula:

$$
S = \sum_{t=0} \frac{reward_{t}}{T_{t}}
$$

The total reward $N_j$ that participant $j$ receives is then calculated as:

$$
N_{j} = \sum_{t=0} stake_{j,t} \times \frac{reward_{t}}{T_{t}}
$$

Solmaz applied Abel's summation by parts to transform this double sequence sum into a form that captures the overall change, not just the individual terms. In mathematics, summation by parts rewrites the sum of products of two sequences into alternative forms. This is also known as Abelâ€™s lemma or the Abel transformation.

Suppose $a_n = (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)$ and $b_n = (b_0, b_1, ..., b_n)$ are two sequences. Then,

**Identity**:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i}b_{i} = a_n \sum_{j=0}^{n} b_j - \sum_{i=1}^{n}((a_i - a_{i-1}) \sum_{j=0}^{i-1}b_j)
$$

The principle is simple. Instead of summing every individual product, you break the sum into two parts, a boundary term and a sum of differences. By focusing only on incremental changes and the final boundary, complex summations become much more tractable.

We assume $n+1$ rewards, indexed by $t=0, ..., n$, and apply the identity to total rewards to obtain:

$$
N_{j} = stake_{j,n} \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{reward_t}{T_t} - \sum_{t=1}^n ((stake_{j,t} - stake_{j,t-1}) \sum_{t=0}^{t-1} \frac{reward_t}{T_t})
$$

We define $R$, short for reward per token, as follows:

$$
R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{t} \frac{reward_k}{T_k}
$$

The change in stake is given by the forward difference operator $\Delta$ between rewards $t-1$ and $t$:

$$
\Delta stake_{j,t} = stake_{j,t} - stake_{j,t-1}
$$

Thus, we can write:

$$
N_j = stake_{j,n} * R_n - \sum_{t=1}^{n} (\Delta stake_{j,t} \times R_{t-1})
$$

While Bogdan's approach tracks $S$ (reward per token) globally, this approach instead keeps track of:

$$
tally_{j,n} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} (\Delta stake_{j,t} \times R_{t-1})
$$

$\Delta stake_{j,t}$ is positive for deposits and negative for withdrawals. Finally, we can calculate $N_j$ as:

$$
N_j = stake_{j,n} * R_n - tally_{j,n}
$$
